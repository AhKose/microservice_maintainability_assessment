# Deep Learning-Based Predictive Evaluation of Microservice Quality: An Approach for  Maintainability Assessment

This repository presents service-based maintainability metrics for open-source Java GitHub projects. Each dataset mentioned in the article is detailed on the shared links and can be also found in related places. 

- **Dataset 1**: Initially created a dataset with project information, assigned numbers, labels, and metrics.
- **Dataset 2**: Outliers removed dataset.
- **Dataset 3**: Augmented dataset with created data points, their metrics, labels, and clustering results.
- **Dataset 4**: Balanced dataset for the fine-tuning process of our proposed transfer learning model.

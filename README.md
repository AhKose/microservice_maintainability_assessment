# Deep Learning-Based Predictive Evaluation of Microservice Quality: An Approach for  Maintainability Assessment

This repository present service-based maintainability metrics for open source java github projects. The each dataset mentioned on article are detailed on the shared links, can be also found on related place. 

- **Dataset 1**: Initially created dataset with project information, assigned numbers, labels, and metrics.
- **Dataset 2**: Outliers removed dataset.
- **Dataset 3**: Augmented dataset with created data points, their metrics, labels, and clustering results.
- **Dataset 4**: Balanced dataset for the fine-tuning process of our proposed transfer learning model.
